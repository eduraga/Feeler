## todo/issues
- [x] Identifying users
  - Added basic user management, but registration needs to be done on a web page
- [ ] Visualization of last activity data (and the different levels)
  - Consider doing this on the browser
- [ ] Visualization of the overall activity (this could be left for a second stage if itâ€™s too much work)
- [ ] Screen capture of computer activity
  - Pheromones.js only workis inside a website which has that installed (works if we want to do it on our web version, but not elsewhere)
- [ ] Download raw data
- [ ] Capture data screens (these need to be synchronized with the boxes and give some feedback (recording time, connection) indicating everything works ok.
- [ ] In the app, the user should be able to delete a session.
