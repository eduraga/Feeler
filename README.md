# feeler

## installation

Without PHP backend
- Change the first in feelerApp.pde line to ```boolean debug = true;```
- The application now runs in 'debug' mode, so you can login by clicking 'L' on the keyboard

With PHP backend
- Install MAMP [https://www.mamp.info/en/] and run it
- Install this [https://github.com/Repox/SimpleUsers] and create a user
  - Edit the configuration file, located at simpleusers/config.inc.php, then run the install script which is located at simpleusers/install.php As an alternative to the install script, edit the configuration file. The tables can be created manually, by opening tables.sql and pasting the tables into phpMyAdmin.
- Change feelerApp/data/config.json to reflect your environment
- Run feelerApp.pde and try to log in
